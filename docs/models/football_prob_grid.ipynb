    "# FootballProbabilityGrid (Model Output)\n",
    "\n",
    "All goals models in `penaltyblog` return a `FootballProbabilityGrid` when you call `.predict(home_team, away_team)`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This object wraps the full exact-score **probability grid** and provides **fast, vectorised access** to popular betting markets and analytics in a single, consistent interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it’s useful\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One object, many markets**: 1X2, BTTS, totals (with **push**), Asian handicaps (including **quarter lines**), double chance, DNB, win to nil, clean sheets, expected points, and more.\n",
    "- **Internally consistent**: Every market is derived from the same score grid, so probabilities never conflict.\n",
    "- **Fast**: Vectorised NumPy operations and lightweight caching for repeated calls.\n",
    "- **Backwards compatible**: Older methods like `total_goals(\"over\", 2.5)` and `asian_handicap(\"home\", -0.5)` still work.\n",

    "### Controlling Grid Normalisation\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, `FootballProbabilityGrid` **normalises** the score grid so that all exact-score probabilities sum to 1. However, you can control this behaviour via the model’s `predict` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Normalised grid (default)\n",
    "pred = model.predict(\"Arsenal\", \"Manchester City\", normalize_grid=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Skip normalisation (use your grid as-is)\n",
    "pred = model.predict(\"Arsenal\", \"Manchester City\", normalize_grid=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `normalize_grid=True` (default) → the returned `FootballProbabilityGrid` normalises its grid.\n",
    "- `normalize_grid=False` → normalisation is skipped (useful if you already normalised externally or are auditing raw grids).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalising vs Not Normalising the Probability Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `.predict(...)`, the model calculates probabilities for all scorelines from 0–`max_goals` (default: 15).  \n",
    "This means extremely high-scoring outcomes (e.g., 16–14) are excluded from the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two approaches to handling this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Not normalising**  \n",
    "  The probability grid keeps its *true* mass, with the missing probability sitting beyond the `max_goals` cut-off.  \n",
    "  This is statistically purist, but it means your derived markets (1X2, totals, Asian handicaps) will not sum exactly to 1.0.  \n",
    "  For example, you might see `home_win + draw + away_win = 0.9999997`. This may be awkward if you need perfectly balanced pricing or hedging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalising**  \n",
    "  The grid is rescaled so that all probabilities sum exactly to 1.0.  \n",
    "  The small “tail” probability beyond `max_goals` is implicitly reallocated proportionally across the included outcomes.  \n",
    "  This ensures all markets are internally consistent - 1X2, totals, and Asian handicap probabilities will align perfectly - and is generally safe if the missing probability mass is negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, `penaltyblog` normalises the grid to avoid confusing inconsistencies in downstream markets.  \n",
    "Advanced users can disable this with `normalize_grid=False` in `.predict()` if they want to inspect the raw, unadjusted probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backwards Compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "- The following legacy-style calls still work exactly as before:\n",
    "    - `pred.total_goals(\"over\"|\"under\", strike)` - returns probability excluding pushes.\n",
    "    - `pred.asian_handicap(\"home\"|\"away\", strike)` - returns win probability only.\n",
    "- Prefer the new, more explicit variants for production:\n",
    "    - `pred.totals(strike)` to obtain (under, push, over)\n",
    "    - `pred.asian_handicap_probs(side, strike)` for Win/Push/Lose\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reproducibility & Export (Optional Tips)\n",
    "Because all markets derive from `pred.grid`, you can export or visualise it for auditing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "grid_df = pd.DataFrame(pred.grid)   # rows: home goals, cols: away goals\n",
    "grid_df.to_csv(\"score_grid.csv\", index_label=\"home_goals\")\n",
    "```\n",

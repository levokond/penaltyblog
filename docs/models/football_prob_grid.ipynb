    "# FootballProbabilityGrid (Model Output)\n",
    "\n",
    "All goals models in `penaltyblog` return a **`FootballProbabilityGrid`** when you call `.predict(home_team, away_team)`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This object wraps the full exact-score **probability grid** and provides **fast, vectorised access** to popular betting markets and analytics in a single, consistent interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it’s useful\n",
    "\n",
    "- **One object, many markets**: 1X2, BTTS, totals (with **push**), Asian handicaps (including **quarter lines**), double chance, DNB, win to nil, clean sheets, expected points, and more.\n",
    "- **Internally consistent**: Every market is derived from the same score grid, so probabilities never conflict.\n",
    "- **Fast**: Vectorised NumPy operations and lightweight caching for repeated calls.\n",
    "- **Backwards compatible**: Older methods like `total_goals(\"over\", 2.5)` and `asian_handicap(\"home\", -0.5)` still work.\n",

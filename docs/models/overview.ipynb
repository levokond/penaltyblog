    "## Goals Models Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `penaltyblog` package provides a suite of **robust, ready-to-use statistical models** for predicting football (soccer) match scores. All models are **highly optimised with Cython** for speed, making them fast, even for large-scale forecasting, betting analysis, and live in-play applications. Whether you want a quick baseline or an advanced model capturing complex goal-scoring patterns, `penaltyblog`'s models provide a consistent, user-friendly API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Poisson Goals Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest and most widely used approach.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Idea**: Goals follow a Poisson distribution, with rates determined by attack strength, defense strength, and home advantage.  \n",
    "- **Strengths**: Easy to understand, quick to fit, good baseline accuracy.  \n",
    "- **Weaknesses**: Overpredicts high scores, struggles with low-score biases.  \n",
    "- **Best for**: General forecasting, fast model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Dixon and Coles Goals Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A refinement of the Poisson model that corrects for the higher-than-expected frequency of low-score draws (e.g., 0-0, 1-0, 1-1).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strengths**: More realistic score predictions in low-scoring leagues, improved match outcome accuracy.  \n",
    "- **Weaknesses**: Adds parameter tuning, assumes the same low-score adjustment for all matches.  \n",
    "- **Best for**: Leagues with many draws or defensive play styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Bivariate Poisson Goals Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Extends the Poisson model by introducing correlation between teams’ goal counts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strengths**: Captures match dynamics affecting both teams, better for high-scoring matches.  \n",
    "- **Weaknesses**: More complex and harder to interpret, slower to fit.  \n",
    "- **Best for**: Leagues where team performances are strongly linked (e.g., end-to-end attacking games).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Zero-Inflated Poisson Goals Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Adds an explicit mechanism for handling excess goalless matches.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strengths**: Improves accuracy in ultra-defensive contexts.  \n",
    "- **Weaknesses**: Only adjusts for excess 0-0 games; doesn’t fix other Poisson issues.  \n",
    "- **Best for**: Competitions or teams with frequent goalless draws.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Negative Binomial Goals Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Handles **overdispersion** - when goal count variance is greater than the mean.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strengths**: More realistic for high-scoring or unpredictable leagues, better at extreme results.  \n",
    "- **Weaknesses**: Still assumes independence between team scores.  \n",
    "- **Best for**: High-variance, goal-heavy competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Weibull Count + Copula Goals Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A more flexible alternative to Poisson-based models, using a Weibull distribution for goals and a copula for score correlation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strengths**: Handles complex goal patterns and diverse score dependencies.  \n",
    "- **Weaknesses**: Statistically and computationally intensive, not always worth the added complexity.  \n",
    "- **Best for**: Advanced modelling in leagues with unusual scoring patterns.\n",

    "## Consistent API Across Models\n",
    "\n",
    "All goal models in `penaltyblog` share the **same interface**, making it simple to switch between them, run comparisons, or fine-tune parameters without rewriting your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design means you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Swap out a Poisson model for a Dixon & Coles model in one line.\n",
    "- Benchmark multiple models on the same dataset with minimal changes.\n",
    "- Apply optimisations (like lookback windows or time weighting) consistently across all models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Every model implements the following core methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `fit()`: Train the model using your dataset.\n",
    "- `predict(home_team, away_team)`: Predict scoreline probabilities for a given fixture.\n",
    "- `get_params()`: Retrieve the model's fited parameters.\n",
    "- `save(filepath)`: Save the model to disk as a pickled file.\n",
    "- `load(filepath)`: Load the saved model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Switching from a Poisson model to a Dixon and Coles model is as simple as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from penaltyblog.models import PoissonGoalsModel, DixonColesGoalsModel\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train a Poisson model\n",
    "model = PoissonGoalsModel(\n",
    "    train[\"goals_home\"],\n",
    "    train[\"goals_away\"],\n",
    "    train[\"team_home\"],\n",
    "    train[\"team_away\"],\n",
    ")\n",
    "model.fit()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Swap to Dixon & Coles\n",
    "model = DixonColesGoalsModel(\n",
    "    train[\"goals_home\"],\n",
    "    train[\"goals_away\"],\n",
    "    train[\"team_home\"],\n",
    "    train[\"team_away\"],\n",
    ")\n",
    "model.fit()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Predict probabilities for a fixture\n",
    "prediction = model.predict(\"Arsenal\", \"Manchester City\")\n",
    "print(prediction.home_draw_away)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the API is consistent, you can automate model testing and tuning. For example, by looping through a list of model classes, fitting each one, and comparing metrics like Ranked Probability Score (RPS) without special-case code."

    "## Time Weighting to Prioritise Recent Matches\n",
    "\n",
    "Football is dynamic - teams change managers, players, and tactics over time. Using too much historical data can let outdated results dilute your predictions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, all `penaltyblog` models support **time weighting**, allowing you to give recent fixtures more influence than older ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common approach is the **Dixon and Coles exponential decay weighting**, where a decay factor `ξ` controls how quickly older matches lose importance:\n",
    "- `ξ = 0` → all matches are weighted equally.\n",
    "- Small `ξ` (e.g., 0.001) → older matches still contribute, but recent ones matter more.\n",
    "- Large `ξ` (e.g., 0.03) → the model focuses heavily on the most recent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from penaltyblog.models import PoissonGoalsModel, dixon_coles_weights\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate weights with a decay factor of 0.001\n",
    "weights = dixon_coles_weights(train[\"date\"], xi=0.001)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fit a Poisson model using time weighting\n",
    "model = PoissonGoalsModel(\n",
    "    train[\"goals_home\"],\n",
    "    train[\"goals_away\"],\n",
    "    train[\"team_home\"],\n",
    "    train[\"team_away\"],\n",
    "    weights=weights\n",
